## Cave goblin song

(Verse 1)  
In the depths of a cave, where the shadows grow tall,  
The party gathered, facing the unknown call.  
Rumata said, “Let's turn back, this feels all wrong,”  
But the group pressed on, determined and strong.  

Telmur, bold as ever, with a glint in his eye,  
Said, “We can capture this goblin, give it a try!”  
But Oliva, soft-hearted, wanted no fight,  
“Let’s talk to the creature, maybe make things right.”  

(Chorus)  
In the dark, in the deep, where the secrets are kept,  
A goblin hides wounded, alone, and bereft.  
They tried to negotiate, they tried to be kind,  
But the goblin’s distrust was all they could find.  

(Verse 2)  
Telmur turned into a rat, sneaking through tight,  
Into the cave, where the shadows took flight.  
He found the goblin, tense and alone,  
Wounded and angry, in a darkened stone home.  

The rat ran back fast, heart pounding with fear,  
“There’s a goblin,” Telmur said, “but nobody else near.”  
The cave now blocked by a pile of stones,  
Sylvanus crawled in, ignoring the moans.  

(Chorus)  
In the dark, in the deep, where the secrets are kept,  
A goblin hides wounded, alone, and bereft.  
They tried to negotiate, they tried to be kind,  
But the goblin’s distrust was all they could find.  

(Bridge)  
Sylvanus, face to face with the goblin’s despair,  
“Why did you try to kill me?” the goblin did glare.  
But Sylvanus spoke softly, offering aid,  
“We’ve a healer with magic, don’t be afraid.”  

Oliva joined in, with a voice full of care,  
“We just want to help, no harm to declare.”  
But the goblin, still wary, eyed them with doubt,  
“I’ll come out, but beware, I’ll still find a way out.”  

(Chorus)  
In the dark, in the deep, where the secrets are kept,  
A goblin hides wounded, alone, and bereft.  
They tried to negotiate, they tried to be kind,  
But the goblin’s distrust was all they could find.  

(Verse 3)  
A deal was struck, with the goblin so frail,  
“If you help us with the map, you’ll not fail.”  
But fear lingered still, deep in his bones,  
“I’ve seen the monster, it’s haunted my home.”  

Telmur asked of the airship, the goblin did blink,  
“You want the big man? You better not think  
Of betraying me now, or the deal is off,  
Let me go, or my wounds you’ll scoff.”  

(Outro)  
In the end, the goblin gave up the map,  
But trust was a ghost in that dim, dark trap.  
“What do you know of Darguun?” he asked with a frown,  
As they left him alone in that shadowed ground.  

In the dark, in the deep, where the secrets were told,  
A goblin’s story, wary and old.  
The party moved on, with the map in their hand,  
But the goblin’s distrust would forever stand.


## Horses song

**(Verse 1)**  
The night was cold, the stars were dim,  
Telmur and Rumata, riding on a whim.  
The horses tired, hungry and sore,  
They set up camp, couldn’t ride anymore.  

Sylvanus found a spot, perfect and neat,  
Telmur lit a fire, to warm their feet.  
Oliva took the first watch, eyes on the night,  
But nothing stirred, not even a fight.  

**(Chorus)**  
Horses whisper in the dark,  
Exhausted, scared, with a weary spark.  
“Where would you go, if you could run?”  
“Home, to the stable, where the day’s begun.”  

**(Verse 2)**  
Rumata stayed awake, though sleep tried to take,  
Sylvanus watched next, not a sound did he make.  
Telmur’s turn came, but sleep was too strong,  
And by morning’s light, something was wrong.  

Telmur woke up, thirty meters away,  
The camp was calm, but a horse went astray.  
“Telmur, did you free the horse while you slept?”  
“Hmmm, I slept well, the whole night I kept!”  

**(Chorus)**  
Horses whisper in the dark,  
Exhausted, scared, with a weary spark.  
“Where would you go, if you could run?”  
“Home, to the stable, where the day’s begun.”  

**(Bridge)**  
Telmur approached the remaining steed,  
“Where’s your friend? Where did she flee?”  
“I slept, I was tired, too tired to know,  
But if she could run, she’d go where the grass grows.”  

“Home! To the stable, where the hay is sweet,  
This is no home, just cold earth at our feet.”  
Telmur sighed, knowing the truth in her tone,  
Horses aren’t wise, but they know where to roam.  

**(Chorus)**  
Horses whisper in the dark,  
Exhausted, scared, with a weary spark.  
“Where would you go, if you could run?”  
“Home, to the stable, where the day’s begun.”  

**(Outro)**  
So they packed up camp, and journeyed ahead,  
With one horse missing, but the path still spread.  
The horses may speak in words so small,  
But their hearts know the way, they remember it all.  

**(Chorus)**  
Horses whisper in the dark,  
Exhausted, scared, with a weary spark.  
“Where would you go, if you could run?”  
“Home, to the stable, where the day’s begun.”
