On the 22nd of month Zarantyr, 998, in Starilaskur

Honored Abbess,
Our efforts to get the map of Mournland did not go quite as planned. As I jumped out of the building very gracefully, the guards that had been alerted were already swarming all around. I did my best to look innocent and tried to hide the bag where I had stashed the safe (no time to break into it). However, the bag swung out from under my cloak and the guards were not very convinced of my innocence after that.

They tied me up and took me to a cell and I had some very interesting conversations with them and was fed excellent bread. I would have gladly stayed a bit longer as I felt we were getting somewhere with the head interrogator, but my battle buddies were determined to break me out.

I later heard that Sylvanus and Thule had returned from their trip to see Jartsa to find the city gates guarded. No one was being let in, and to pass the time the guards recommended some card games and low-grade mead in the tent village. However, after some hard bargaining, they got in past the guards, their coin purses a bit lighter.

The pair found Phonzy, who was fake drunk and, to allay the suspicions of some approaching guards, even threw up. The three went to the inn where they heard wild, exaggerated stories of what had upset the guards, including that the prince’s bodyguards had been murdered, and the prince was underground. Naturally that could be true as well, though not by our hand.

The innkeeper agreed to take our names off the book after some threats. Clearly a win-win, as now the innkeeper is not officially mixed up in any of this map heist business and our tracks are less well documented. They did some planning around rescuing me and the magic bag.

Meanwhile I was in my windowless cell where runes adorned the walls. A captain was trying to get some information out of me, and the safe out of the bag. Apparently, some people have some learning to do when it comes to the workings of magic bags.

I was also questioned by some higher-ranking person who tried to give me a memory test and was very interested in my circle of pen pals. He did not seem to take the interrogations too seriously. Next, I spent some time meditating. I heard some steps, so I yelled to inquire whether they had grown tired of keeping an innocent person locked up but got no response.

My four friends had all found each other by then and headed to the forest. Phonzy had disguised himself to “Jonzy” and made his way to the tent village where he drank some mead and played the cards at the recommendation of the guards that Sylvanus and Thule passed on. Sylvanus, Telmuir and Thule took a more direct approach. Sylvanus shot the two guards at the entrance skillfully, covered by a silencing spell from Telmuir, and they dragged the bodies behind a tree. 

They made their way towards where they expected the cells to be. Apparently, the guards were talking about the prince’s room being on fire, courtesy of our group. To my knowledge “Jonzy” only set out some fires in some trees, alas.

Since I could hear the guards readying for an incoming attack, I decided it was a good time to pick the lock on my cell door. I would have quite liked some more of that bread, but it was not to be. I walked along the corridor and when I opened a door at the end, Telmuir was already there waiting! Sylvanus was shooting her bow very well, and Thule cut off an officer’s limbs. A scared soldier turned away from the battle and towards us and threw his spear at me. I caught it and threw it back. Telmuir drew his scimitar out and straight through the chest of the soldier. Some bigger guy fled at this point, but we caught him and I knocked him out. I really think we could have found a more peaceful way to solve this.

After this we started sneaking out. We could hear voices from outside. They had found the bodies hidden behind the trees. We snuck upstairs. I tried to pick the lock I had already picked before, but the lock could not take any more picking and broke. Thule smashed the door open. I found my special bag and checked that the safe was still safe. The rest of my stuff was somewhere else and I could not get it back. I’m writing you this letter on paper I borrowed from Phonzy (I’m not sure if Telmuir and Sylvanus like paper, as it is often made from their precious trees).

We could see two guards from the window.  Telmuir changed into a monkey, swung out of the window, and onto the roof. He was shot at by a guard in a guard tower, got down, got hit, turned into a dwarf and then into a mouse and scurried away into the safety of the trees.

Sylvanus jumped on a guard, knocking him out. Thule tried to hit the other guard but missed, so I finished the job. Meanwhile, “Jonzy” was setting fire to a rich people house and making his way towards the agreed on regroup spot.

We traveled into the hills and then set up camp. I got the safe to open. Inside was a map of Cyre before the fall, marked with some House Canit bases. Then a slip or paper with long number combinations. And a torn off page from a notebook, with the text “We never should have touched it. It was something else instead. J.H.”, and a House Canit logo on the page.

I do not know when I will be able to send these last letters. After our latest stunt we may not be able to walk into any towns in a while.

Yours faithfully,
Oliva
