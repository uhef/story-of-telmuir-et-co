Previous: Shadow in the "New Cyre". Telmur was excausted, but carnival game was won. The money was put in the shared bank account named "PORTS", from all characters first letters of their names. Cat, weird creature, Sylvanus disappeared. Current characters:

* Sylvanus
* Oliva
* Rumata
* Telmur

Eberron system, with modifications.

We (except Sylvanus who teleported away) are in the forest. Creature is not seen either. Telumr is exhausted and bewildered: "where is Sylvanus?"
Oliva: "it disappeared, and the creature was using a weird language"
Telmur tries to remember what the language is about, he has heard of Abusal, something related to the Kyber: "The creature is not from this world, Kyber knows this language."

(This world has rings that dragons like Kyber left.)

Oliva: "do they hunt here, or do they target us on purpose?"

We still have horses and carriage, but without roof (it was burned).

Rumata has woken up from the carriage.

The group hears a faint voice of Sylvanus from nearby: "help..." and they can see her 50 meters away. "I need booze...". It's definitely Sylvanus. She said she was teleported to the hut, found a map about Darguun area, tried to catch wounded goblin, but the goblin escaped. Sylvanus managed to find a way with the help of the map. Map is on pergament so better not take it out in the heavy rain. The group tries to make a cover.

Rumata crawled under the carriage with just ripped Tuule's pants (for protections!) to take a look at the map. He accidentally dropped the map, but managed to see two marked bases. On the mountain side, south of New Cyre - an airship symbol. The second mark was a hut nearby. The group is now to the North of New Cyre. 

Group decided to go towards New Cyre, but maybe visit the hut nearby before.

Oliva decided to gauge wether Sylvanus is real or impostor. Sylvanus is real!

Carriage has to be kept. Decided to check if carriage can be protected. Carriage was made completely stealth. Tuule is on the horse semi-concisious (pantless, but Rumata returned them to him).

Telmur keeps attention on possible magic, and Oliva+Rumata on possible traps.

Hut is small, the door is open, nothing there, with small bed and rudemntary table (where the now lost map was found). Telmur investages outside and founds some bones, probably belonging to humanoid, with rag clothing. Somebody was eaten, Telmur can see from scratches on the bones! Goblin are not humanoid eaters, so goblin is very unlikely to be a perpetrator. Maybe alcohol saved Sylvanus from being eaten: her liver is poison. Sylvanus tries to track the golbin. She feels the scent of the goblin, and faint trail of the goblin in the opposite direction from where the group arrived. The group decided to follow the track, with two horses (but no carriage), to the east, and then slightly to the south. Goblin track has disappeared, but then there was a bigger track on four legs. Telmur tries to understand the nature of the animal's track - it's a canine! 🐺 Were-goblin maybe? Maybe golbin was picked up by the beast? Or goblin riding the wolf?

The group argues what to do - follow the wounded goblin/wolf or try to find the marked airship. And also pondering whether creature are immediate eaters or eat-later kind. Telmur: "Sylvanus, what did goblin tell you?" - "It was wounded!" Time passes by, rain continues... Telmur still wants to investage the tracks, group reluctantly agrees. Group is super focused on the twisted track path, and lost the idea where they are. "Is it here?" "Yes, go on!" "Turn left!"

By some miracle, still outside of mountaints, on a hill, tracks goes into some opening in the hill. Maybe the cave?

Rumata doesn't like this and wants to turn back. Group continues the discussion and maybe negotiate with the goblin when they found him. "We can capture the golbin!" says Telmur. Oliva does not want to hurt anyone. Telmur decided to turn into a rat to go into the opening. The cave is small, but then the rat notices the tense turn and the wounded goblin. The golbin looks at the rat angrily. Nobody else there. Rat runs away as fast as it can. Telmur turns back into dwarf: "there was a goblin, but nobody else". Horses are tied up. Oliva suggests to negiotate with the wounded goblin. The cave is now covered wioth rocks, and Sylvanus can't get there. Sylvanus still tries to get in, with legs sticking out.

Sylvanus sees the same wounded goblin: fear, depression: "Why did you try to kill me?" says goblin. Sylvanus tries to calm the goblin down: "We can cure you! We have a magic-power doctor with us!" Goblin is not buying this at all. Oliva: "we can help you!". Sylvanus tries to intimidate the goblin. "Okay, I come out. Evil!" Sylvanus backs out. It's a goblin, maybe meaner-looking than usual, not armed and scared. But the golbin is clearly not trusting you. "I can help with the wounds if you can help us with the map" - says Telmur.

Goblin: "Ok, it's my map, it's my map. I use it when I can."

Oliva: "why do you live alone? Are you were-golbin?"

Goblin: "No, but I've seen the monster, it attacked me!"

Telmur: "Airship?"

Goblin: "you want to find big man, you let me go" (tries to go back)

Goblin: "what do you know about Darguun? Darguun is a new country, big boss goblin is Less Haruk Sharat, it united all clans. Part people, part goblin, they fight, they good engineers. We create big nation, we take over Darguun! And the ship is where the map is."

Oliva feels it's not a full story.

Telmur: "What about Baron Utrak?"
Goblin: "Yes, big man! They are good warriors, they are good engineers! Okay, I go now."
Telmur: "Can we heal you?"

Goblin rans away. Even Sylvanus leaves the goblin alone, Sylvanus is different...

Rumata goes to look into the cave, nothing there except the blood stains.

Rain stops.

Telmur: "Let's good to New Cyre! But we are lost... Let's go West, we can try to intercept the road and then head south to get to New Cyre. We can do it until it gets dark."

Telmur and Rumata (both are short and slow) gets on the remaining (not-Tuule's) horse, the rest on foot and managed to reach the road and headed south. The horses are very excausted and scared and hungry. The group decided to camp during the night. Sylvanus managed to find a perfect camping spot. Telmur make a bonfire for warmths. Oliva takes the first shift, she doesn't notice anything. Rumata goes next, almost fall asleep but manages to keep awake. Sylvanus doesn't notice anything. During Telmur's final shift, he fells asleep, everybody is sleeping.

Morning wakes everything, everybody is fresh, except Telmur woke up 30 meters away from everybody, in the plains. The group realizes one horse is missing.

"Telmur, did you free the horse while sleepwalking?"
"Hmm... I slept very well."

Telmur goes to the other horse and ask her where her friend went. "I slept! I was really tired." - "Where would you go?" - "Home! Stable! Food!" - "Where is your home?" - "This is no home!" Well, it's a horse, they are not super intelligent.

The group decided to go to New Cire. Telmur turns into a horse, and Rumata rides him.

The group find the guards in front of the town. "Have you seen the single horse?" - "Have you lost one?" - "Yes, the horse likely sleeped walked" - "No horses, except for the metallic bear and own." - "Is it usual down here?" - "Anything can happen here, usually people hop on and off and nobody talks to me. Have a nice day!"

"Jihaa!" - says Telmur-the-horse and turns back into dwarf.

Telmur loves the town, it's horse, shit, and smell. Sylvanus loves it too.

Oliva talks about the lost horse and the lost carriage. Lot's of elaborate theories and suggestions. The group considers o ask how expensive is the lost horse and the lost carriage. Telmur suggests to pretend that we don't know anything. Oliva says it does not work like this in this world: "Let's speak the truth"

In the meantime older lady approaches the group, in darker tones: "Have you lost your horse? I may help you. I am good at locating animals. I have this skill that was tought by my grandmother, and her grandmother talk my grandmother. We are good at finding horses. I just need a little bit of food and wood. My home is in forest from the south exit of the town. I will go prepare my spell. Good to you!"

The group goes to the market square, to find "meaty food" and wood.

Tuule goes to the tavern. Sylvanus wanted to go too, but she was stopped by the rest.

Oliva talks to the sales person and asks about the horse-searcher lady. She is told about the myst and mysteries in the myst: "many people here promise many things..."

Oliva to the group: "what if horse-searcher lady is the monster?!"

After getting the food and the wood and leaving the town from the south, the guard says "Be careful, I don't go here. Some don't go back, some go back and sad." - "Did you see the old woman?" - "She is okay, I once bought cookie from her, very good cookies." - "Thank you for the warning".

Outside of the town, forest goes quite dark, and dangerous, the air goes bad for the throat. The groups arrives at the tree house. Next to it there a carrot farm. 

Rumata goes into the tree house, with the wood and pork in hand. Rumata knocks on the wooden door. "Dear, who is there? You alone, come inside". Rumata enters into the tree house. The door closes magically behinds him. Inside a huge two stories house, much bigger than outside. Something is brewing. A lot of rooms upstairs. Granny: "oh, it's the small one. Please leave wood and food here. Let's find your horse."

Lady turns into Rumata: "please follow me the backyard, I can show where your hourse is".

Inside, there is another door to the backyard: "please go to the bush and stand there". Rumata does so and turns to the right and see the horse, dead. The nice granny turns an ugly witch and knocks Rumata out. Some time later Rumata find himself tied in the garden, with hands behind the back and the mouth covered. And Rumata hears some noise from the house. He manages to partly untie himself and hides in the bush.

The lady starts to look for Rumata but cannot see him, gets angry and curses something in the language that Rumata cannot understand. Witch says "I can see you" and looks directly towards Rumata in the bush. Rumata walks out, witch knocks Rumata out. The attempt to run away didn't work.

The group outside of the tree house starts to get suspicios, and also hears devil sounds and comotion in the treehouse. Sylvanus gets in and attacks the witch. Witch yells something devilish, and Sylvanus transformed into a mouse by the witch. Oliva joins the fight and attacks with a quarterstaff and knocks the witch down. Telmur joins and undoes the spell and returns Sylvanus back into unmouse form. Witch wakes up and exhales with a magic breath, but that didn't work. Witch flies to the second of the floor of the house. Oliva jumps up and hits witch heavily. Telmurs brings Rumata back to life with magic. The witch turns her hands into portal next to fire place and burns Oliva with fire and thunder. Telmur summons creatures from another dimensions: two wolves. The groups wins. The house starts to shrink.
