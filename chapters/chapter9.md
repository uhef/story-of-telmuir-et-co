# Mist and prics thick as mince

After saving Oliva, who had foolishly been captured, our heroes had retreated to a nearby peaceful forest and figured out that luckily they actually got the map for the Cyre within the Mournlands. Being a bit flabbergasted on what is going and feeling the weight of the choices they made in effort to save Oliva, they decide to travel to meet Jartsa in hopes of acquiring more information. On their way the almost got trampled by horseriders who engage our heroes in a battle after recognizing them to be the ones that wreaked havoc previously. In the end the poor excuse-for-a-soldier wankers are mainly a nuissance, as fireballs and arrows prove yet again to be powerful.

Unfortunataly no Jartsa was found in his cabin. The heroes notice that the mist seems to continue spreading. They decide to investigate an area filled with the more dense kind of mist, where they find a Wright circiling something. After getting rid of the irritating ghostly prick they realize, that the mist is actually being distributed by a weird pipe-like thing, bearing the crest of a certain House and the already familiar dimwit: Jartsa. 

As the journey continued towards Kennrun, Phonzy had some not-so-relaxing dreams, where the Patron was losing it's cool and wanting some more fires to be set ablaze. In Kennrun Phonzy puts on a nice makeup and manages to get himself inside the city without rising any suspicions, which is good, as the place has been filled with wanted notices of the party. In the city he learns, that SEPPE has visited the town two days ago. Also he has a great discussion on the recent fight in the Starilaskur arena. Phonzy joins the rest of the party to plan their next move. But his Patreon knows what the next move should be. 

Fire.
