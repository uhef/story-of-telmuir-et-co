Honored Abbess,

I hope everything is well, and the issue with the novice that brother Ingoss mentioned in his
latest communication has been dealt with.

I had the first good night’s sleep in a while now that we have arrived at Trolanport. The city is
overall very clean. They even have lamps lighting up the streets, lit by magic. No dark alleyways.
Can they truly have sweeped the place so tidy? Telmuir thinks that the outward cleanest places
are the most rotten inside.

In any case, it is important to be presentable while we stay here. While I was distrustful of the
stranger offering to preen our party’s clothes on our arrival, we were not swindled. The effects
are still present.

While we were eating breakfast and thinking of spells our druid could be in need of, a gnome
brought us a stone and a scroll and immediately left. The stone is for one time only
communication once we have something to tell. We simply say the password “Xend” and then
we can speak 15 words. Since the scroll had the correct seal, it is probably real. (I have
recreated the seal for you at the end of this letter.)

To find out more about who had betrayed House Lyrandar and why, we decided to head for the
docks to find out more about the soarwood business. On our walk we mostly saw gnomes and a
few metal persons who were going about their own business. Some posters for a missing cat
caught my eye, and I kept an eye out for it.

Once we got to the sea, a stone wall was blocking the direct path. Some gnomes were hurrying
to work, using magic badges to get through the gates. There were no people there to supervise
the process, meaning no one we could talk to. It was suggested we beat up a few workers and
steal their badges, but we decided against it. After all, everyone we have talked to here has been
adamant on not using violence or practising crime while here.

Since there was no going through the wall without a badge, we went around it. Walking along the
wall, we arrived at a manned opening. Telmuir explained that we are working for House Lyrandar
and here to see the building process of airships. Our barbarian tried to take on a fellow worker
man’s role but unsuccesfully. The gnome worker explained that they don’t do business with
House Lyrandar, there is no flyship order from them, and if there was, they would not tell us.
They only refine the kyber dragon shards here to finish the ships – it is a delicate process and
closed from outsiders.

Getting nowhere, we kept on walking. The impenetrable wall changed into a less secretive area,
and the gnome manning the next opening was more jovial. We went with the same story: we are
here to audit the process of building ships for our patrons at House Lyrandar in preparation for
the next order. The gnome was taken aback by the party having no full elves and only one halfelf. It muttered to itself about the standards getting lower. We were then told that the last
purchase from House Lyrandar was delivered a month ago.

Wearing glowing vests that made us stand out, we entered the shipyard with instructions not to
be in the way. It was not one minute of observing the unfinished ship and we were already
getting yelled at to move. Heading towards the back we saw a shed and knocked. A bored elf let
us enter, and held a conversation with Sylvanys about whatever in Elvish, and then we went
back outside.

There was an explosion and everyone was running: some away to safety, some towards the
scene right next to us, behind the stone walls. The elf we’d just talked to locked himself into the
shed along with all the documents that might contain answers to questions such as had any
soarwood gone missing? We saw a good opportunity to get the papers now that there was all
this commotion. Pretending to be the official authorities, we knocked on the door again and
stated that everyone needed to clear the area and get to safety. The elf did not believe us so we
kicked in the door and coaxed the frightened fellow out. The papers were a mess to go through.
While Thule kept watch, I found the orders for regular sea ships. The last order for a flying ship
was from a year ago. Apparently the hull takes three months to make, and then three more for
an airship? There were also elemental water ships, whatever they are. The last one was finished
a month ago.

Sylvanus found out that two of the soarwood shipments sent from Aerenal had not been
received. The last order was from three months ago. Maybe there were no airship orders
because the ship builders don’t have materials to make one? But then why do the workers next
door keep banging away?

Having spent a while rummaging through the papers we headed out. The gnome back at the gate
was surprised to see us still here. There were a lot of people still outside the stone walls,
wondering what had happened. I did not see the missing cat. The city people were talking,
worried about the war starting back up again. Then we were again ambushed by a new gnome
suddenly standing behind us and stating that the situation was very curious. The gnome Kasteer
invited us to talk at his tea shop as compensation for all the hardships we had been put through.
While witnessing an explosion did not seem such a huge burden, we still accepted. The gnome
blabbered on all the way to the tea shop, telling us about his past as a tinkerer, building things
lesser than the airships which are, after all, the pride of the city. Once there, we had our choice
of tea, ale, and pastries made in honor of the national poet. Very good.

David, the elf at the shipyard, had talked to Kasteer about us running around knocking on and
down doors. They are a part of some (suspicious?) operation that makes sure things stay in
order. Kasteer was asking us about the explosion, but really he knew more than us. The
organisation led by Uthrak was behind the attack. The demolitionists had already fled every
which way and were not our concern. However, the gnome did have a task for us: go east to
where the dragon stone is mined and make sure the next shipment comes through unharmed.

I described the missing cat to the gnome. He had not seen it, but suggested that Talina, an
innkeeper outside the city and on our way east, might know where the cat had wound up. When
we left, we walked through the city square and I bought a very expensive and very tasty, pulled
apart version of the national poet’s pastry. We discussed our plans at length. In the evening, yet
another gnome came by to confirm our travel plans east. It will take a week to travel to
Zolanberg and Deep Mine, or something like this – I don’t have a map at hand while writing to
you now.

We slept another night, very well again, and left for our next stop, Talina’s tavern, in the morning.
A carriage was waiting for us – much better than riding on horses as it was raining. The
forestscape changed as we travelled, turning to dry land woods, all still very foreign to me.
Telmuir and Sylvanus were naturally enamored by the changing nature. I was happy to see that
the sides of the road were kept clear. No hiding spots for bandits.

Talina’s tavern was a one story building. Talina was a small, blue haired, pierced gnome. We
were given a simple room. Rumata, who had been feeling ill, only got up long enough to walk
from the carriage to his bed. I’m not sure at which point we should be worried that the poison
flesh that the fishmen gave him to eat did some real damage. Now – have your contacts been
able to find any leads on his child?

There were still daylight hours left, and as you know some of my companions are rowdy and
eager to have something to do. After sitting in the carriage all day I can’t blame them. Talina told
us about an old gnome couple, the Hellstens, who are the latest locals to have cattle gone
missing. The cattle roams freely near the stream, where a half eaten cow was found. From the
carcass, Sylvanus tracked a set of bear prints to a cave. We found out it was not a bear but
rather an owlbear, when the thing leaped at us from above.

Thule and Sylvanus hit the owlbear hard. The thing got a good slam back into Thule, but Telmuir
rescued our companion. I got a few good strikes in with my elbows, and the owlbear fell to its
side dead. The killing blow might have been mine. It is also possible the beast was already dead
from Sylvanus’ arrows while I was pummeling away.

The Hellstens were grateful and asked where to find the owlbear body – let not good meat go to
waste. We heard that people at the Goranberg library would be interested to know of an owlbear
sighting this far south. There may be a reward involved.

We talked to a bard passing by who told us that while the roads are safe, there’s a growing
restlessness in the east. The Trust is losing its grip. We learned more about Uthrak as well: he’s
growing his influence in the Stormreach area. They say he can cut a person in half with one
strike, and has powers of a god.

Next morning a new carriage was ready to take us into Oscilor city. It is quite large, comprised
mostly of gnome craftsmen and artisans. The road there was busier. We left behind the forests
and travelled alongside a river. The river split into two – if we had followed the other stream, we
could have made it to Pylas Pyrial, an abandoned temple fallen into ruins. The temple is not
easy to find, and has been left empty for a long time.

The next tavern that we stayed at was fancier. Rumata was still sick. The Olarune moon was to
be full that night. We spent the evening discussing what would happen if Thule, damaged by the
owlbear, were to turn into a wereowlbear. Should he be locked up for our safety?

In the night while we lay in our beds, Telmuir bumped into me. He explained that he needed
some fresh air. However, I saw through the window that he was staring at his hands like there
was something wrong with them.

Another morning, another carriage ride. Our gnome rider talked us into taking a shortcut through
the woods. I suppose it is not a hard sell since we have two tree enthusiasts with us. The gnome
was telling me all about how to ride a carriage when there was a fallen tree on the path ahead
us. Then arrows were flying, and I started hitting at the first scoundrel that appeared in front of
me. Thule and I were fighting on one side of the wagon. I could hear some words from behind,
where Telmuir and Sylvanus had their own battle going on, such as “stop with the panting”. I
could not make sense what this referred to. My opponent kept dodging my hits. Telmuir seemed
to have better luck, as his flaming scimitar was sinking into bodies like a knife into warm butter. I
could smell frying flesh. In the end we prevailed (as you might have guessed since I am still
writing this to you).

Sylvanus collected some poison infused arrows off our dead opponents. We can have those
made into darts for me.

As an aside, I had an idea – could you make just a stick, like say modelled after a broom – out of
flywood and fly on it? You could tie some bags and pouches into the back of the broom and they
would not slide off because of the broom head that are in the way. One could make quick
deliveries in this way.

Yours faithfully,

Oliva
