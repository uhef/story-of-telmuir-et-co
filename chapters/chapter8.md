# Chapter Eight: Close Call

The mist clung thickly to the forest, muffling the sounds of movement as Phonzy and Telmur pressed forward. Somewhere ahead, Uthrak's crashed airship lay hidden in the dense fog, its wreckage a silent promise of danger. Their journey had been slow—Phonzy, still weakened, relied on Telmur's aid. Even with his usual resilience, the warlock’s steps faltered, prompting Telmur to quietly invoke a healing spell. 

A faint chittering sound broke the silence. Phonzy’s pseudodragon familiar stiffened, then gave a low, urgent hiss. Something lurked nearby, unseen but unmistakably unnatural. They crouched low, instincts honed from countless encounters with the unknown. A shadow floated through the mist—humanoid, yet insubstantial. It drifted soundlessly, oblivious to their presence, its form wavering like smoke caught in an unseen wind. The adventurers held their breath, muscles coiled for flight. If it turned toward them, there would be no choice but to run.

But the shadow passed. They let out a slow, measured breath. 

They had no way of knowing that, at that moment, Sylvanus was scaling the craggy peak southeast of Rockhart. A message from house Lyrandar had reached him, instructing him to ascend to a high vantage point for extraction. He moved swiftly, finding a suitable clearing where the airship could land. As the sky darkened, the familiar shape of the Lyrandar vessel loomed in the distance. With practiced ease, Sylvanus set a pair of torches ablaze, their flickering light a beacon against the twilight. The ship descended, rope ladders unfurling. In a show of effortless grace, Sylvanus vaulted onto the ladder and climbed aboard. Thule followed soon after, exhaustion weighing heavily upon him. 

Aboard the vessel, negotiations were swift. A single spare breathing mask remained, and as Thule slumped into a seat, Sylvanus took it for himself. The Lyrandar crew, hesitant at first, eventually agreed to return to the crash site to search for the others. And so, they set course for the misty expanse where Phonzy and Telmur continued their hunt.

The moment of reunion came unexpectedly. Sylvanus, using his keen tracking abilities, found his companions by following their subtle trail—markings left in the trees, symbols in the dirt. He moved like a shadow himself, weaving effortlessly through the undergrowth until, at last, he saw them.

They did not have long to celebrate. The airship was close, but so were Uthrak’s men. A misstep: Sylvanus' hair catching on a low-hanging branch—sent a sharp snap through the silence. The enemy’s attention snapped toward them. Shouts rang out.

Then Phonzy lit the fuse.

The dynamite arced through the air, landing on the enemy’s ship. A deafening explosion ripped through the night, tearing a gaping hole in the hull. Splintered wood and metal shrapnel rained down as one of Uthrak’s men crumpled to the deck, mortally wounded. The blast revealed the vessel’s dragonshard engine, pulsing with volatile energy.

Telmur reacted instantly. Raising his hands, he channeled a bolt of lightning straight into the exposed core. The explosion that followed was catastrophic. The ship’s stern disintegrated in a fiery eruption, sending debris hurtling through the air. Uthrak, his eyes wild with fury, drove his sword into the deck, anchoring himself against the force of the blast.

But they were not alone in the mist. The explosion had drawn something else.

A shadow emerged, gliding silently toward them. The entity from before—its presence colder, more deliberate. Phonzy wasted no time. With a flick of his wrist, he sent a fireball roaring through the fog, erupting between the specter and Uthrak’s remaining crew.

Uthrak moved swiftly. With a single leap, he landed between Telmur and Sylvanus, his blade flashing through the air. The druid staggered, shifting forms with a growl. Dire wolves materialized beside him, their snarls filling the night. Yet Uthrak was relentless. With a flick of his wrist, his whip coiled around Sylvanus, yanking him back into the fray.

Steel met steel as Sylvanus fought back, his swords carving through the air. The specter lashed out but found nothing but mist as it failed to grasp Telmur. Uthrak struck again, but his sword slipped from his grasp—only for him to snatch it midair and drive it into Telmur’s bear-form. The beast bellowed in pain.

Phonzy, eyes burning with eldritch power, sent twin blasts of energy crashing into Uthrak. The warlord staggered back. Telmur, weakened but defiant, whispered an incantation, and in an instant, his body shimmered and vanished—reappearing yards away in a blink of misty magic.

Uthrak turned, his gaze locking onto Sylvanus. His blade came down hard.

Darkness swallowed Sylvanus as he crumpled to the ground.

Telmur, fury burning in his chest, cast a desperate spell. The ground trembled as magical force surged toward Uthrak. But the warlord, grinning, drove his sword into the dirt. The energy dissipated as the last gemstone in his hilt flickered and died. 

Phonzy let out a strangled curse. He unleashed one final blast, sending Uthrak reeling. Telmur, breathless, transformed—his form shifting into that of a massive steed. Without hesitation, Phonzy and Sylvanus, barely conscious, scrambled onto his back. 

They rode hard into the night.

Behind them, the wreck of Uthrak’s ship smoldered. In the distance, the shadow watched, unmoving.

The road to Kennrun was long and silent. When they finally arrived at the small village, exhaustion overtook them. The local innkeeper, unfazed by the dirt and blood that stained their clothes, served them a simple meal of ale and dried meat. 

For a handful of gold, they were given a place to rest.

Sleep came swiftly, their bodies surrendering to much-needed respite. But even in dreams, the echoes of battle remained. 

And somewhere, in the depths of Phonzy’s mind, his patron’s voice whispered, dissatisfied.

They had let Uthrak live.
